# deepseek-r1-local-chatbot
small project to get familiar with creating tools with pre-trained models

The initial project will utilize the streamLit UI from my CAPSTONE project and I will utilize a local instance of deepseek R1 to create a simple bot



I was able to implement the code to run the UI and begin loading the chatbot. Unfortunately, I do not have hardware compatable with the mehthod I wanted to pursue, I discovered the use of Ollama to achieve a similar result, and I am exploring connecting them to my projects for enhanced modularity with model selection.
